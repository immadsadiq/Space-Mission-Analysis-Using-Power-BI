# Space-Mission-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

In this mission analysis project conducted using Power BI, I delve into the vast realm of space missions over the years. Through comprehensive data visualization, I illustrate trends and insights surrounding mission success rates, successful missions, total expenditure, and more. By plotting missions over the years, I provide a dynamic visualization of the evolution of space exploration. Additionally, I analyze missions by location, offering a geographical perspective on space endeavors.

Furthermore, I dissect successful missions by company, shedding light on the contributions of different organizations to space exploration. Utilizing Power BI's capabilities, I present a breakdown of missions by rocket type, unveiling the prevalence of various rocket technologies in space missions. Additionally, I dissect mission statuses, categorizing them into successful, failed, and partial failures, providing a nuanced understanding of mission outcomes.

Through this analysis, I aim to deliver actionable insights into the intricacies of space missions, aiding stakeholders in decision-making processes and strategic planning. If you're seeking a comprehensive analysis of space missions leveraging Power BI's capabilities, look no further. Let's collaborate and uncover the secrets of the cosmos together!
